            Task: Investigate why the CI named "${{ env.FAILED_WORKFLOW }}" failed and make the minimal, safe code changes to fix it.
            Context: amp-benchkit is a Python project. The CI runs pytest with coverage, ruff, and mypy (allow incomplete).
            Steps:
              1) Run tests and linters locally.
              2) Read error output, identify the root cause.
              3) Modify code and/or tests to fix the failure.
              4) Re-run checks locally to confirm green.
              5) Write a concise commit message describing the fix.
